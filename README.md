# char-converter

This tool can complete two tasks: take in a file and convert non-ASCII characters to unicode, as well as take a file and convert unicode to symbols. 

It is used primarily in localization efforts, where .properties and .json files contain key/value pairs, with values existing in different languages, which can sometimes not display correctly in the UI.  

CharConverter uses Node.
